# Problem 1. Database
You are provided with a simple class â€“ Database, which stores integers. The constructor receives an array of numbers,<br/> which is added into a private field.
The database has the functionality to add, remove and fetch all stored items.<br/> Your task is to test the class. In other words,
write tests, so you are sure its methods are working as intended.

**Constraints**

- Storing array's capacity must be exactly 16 integers
  - If the size of the array is not 16 integers long, InvalidOperationException is thrown
- The "Add()" operation, should add an element at the next free cell (just like a stack)
  - If there are 16 elements in the Database and try to add 17th, InvalidOperationException is thrown
- The "Remove()" operation, should support only removing an element at the last index (just like a stack)
  - If you try to remove an element from an empty Database, InvalidOperationException is thrown
- Constructors should take integers only, and store them in the array
- The "Fetch()" method should return the elements as an array

# Problem 2. Extended Database
You already have a class - Database. We have modified it and added some more functionality to it.<br/> It supports adding, removing, and finding People.
In other words, it stores People. 

There are two types of finding methods - first: "FindById (long id)" and the second one: "FindByUsername (string username)".

As you may guess, each person has unique id and unique username. Your task is to test the provided project.

**Constraints**

The database should have methods:
- Add
  - If there are already users with this username, InvalidOperationException is thrown
  - If there are already users with this id, InvalidOperationException is thrown
- Remove
- FindByUsername
  - If no user is present by this username, InvalidOperationException is thrown.
  - If the username parameter is null, ArgumentNullException is thrown
  - Arguments are all CaseSensitive
- FindById
  - If no user is present by this id, InvalidOperationException is thrown
  - If negative ids are found, ArgumentOutOfRangeException is thrown

# Problem 3. Car Manager
You are provided with a simple project containing only one class - "Car". The provided class is simple - its main point is to represent some of the functionality of a car. Each car contains information about its Make, Model, Fuel Consumption, Fuel Amount, and Fuel Capacity. Also, each car can add some fuel to its tank by refueling and can travel distance by driving. To be driven, our car needs to have enough fuel. Everything in the provided skeleton is working perfectly fine and you mustn't change it.

In the skeleton, you are provided Test Project named "CarManager.Tests". There you should place all the unit tests you write. The Test Project has only one class inside:

- "CarTests" - here you should place all code testing the "Car" and its functionality.

Your job now is to write unit tests on the provided project and its functionality. You should test exactly every part of the code inside the "Car" class:
- You should test all the constructors
- You should test all properties (getters and setters)
- You should test all the methods and validations inside the class

Before you submit your solution to Judge, you should remove all the references and namespaces referencing the other project. You should upload only the "CarManager.Tests" project holding the class with your tests. Remove the "bin" and "obj" folders before submission.

**Constraints**

- Everything in the provided skeleton is working perfectly fine
- You mustn't change anything in the project structure
- You can test both constructors together
- You shouldn't test the auto-properties
- Any part of validation should be tested
- There is no limit on the tests you will write but keep your attention on the main functionality

# Problem 4. Fighting Arena
You are provided with a project named "FightingArena" containing two classes - "Warrior" and "Arena". Your task here is simple - you need to write tests on the project covering the whole functionality. But before start writing tests, you need to get to know the project's structure and business logic. Each Arena has a collection of Warriors enrolled for the fights. In the Arena, Warriors should be able to Enroll in the fights and fight each other. Each Warrior has a unique name, damage, and HP. Warriors can attack other Warriors. Of course, there is validations:

- Name cannot be null, empty, or whitespace
- Damage cannot be zero or negative
- HP cannot be negative
- Warrior cannot attack if his HP is below 30
- Warrior cannot attack Warriors whose HP are below 30
- Warrior cannot attack stronger enemies

On the Arena there should be performed some validations too:
- Already enrolled Warriors should not be able to enroll again
- There cannot be a figh if one of the Warriors is not enrolled for the fights

In the skeleton, you are provided Test Project named "FightingArena.Tests". There you should place all the unit tests you write. The Test Project has two classes inside:
- "WarriorTests" - here you should place all code testing the "Warrior" and its functionality
- "ArenaTests" - here you should place all code testing the "Arena" and its functionality

Your job now is to write unit tests on the provided project and its functionality. You should test exactly every part of the code inside the "Warrior" and "Arena" classes:
- You should test all the constructors
- You should test all properties (getters and setters)
- You should test all the methods and validations inside the class

Before you submit your solution to Judge, you should remove all the references and namespaces referencing the other project. You should upload only the "FightingArena.Tests" project holding the two classes with your tests. Remove the "bin" and "obj" folders before submission.

**Constraints**

- Everything in the provided skeleton is working perfectly fine
- You mustn't change anything in the project structure
- You shouldn't test the auto-properties
- Any part of validation should be tested
- There is no limit on the tests you will write but keep your attention on the main functionality
