**Your Task**

Write the missing JavaScript code to make the Music Site work as expected:
-	All fields (genre, name, author, and date) are filled with the correct input
    -	Genre, name, author, and date are non-empty strings
-	The program should not do anything if any of the input fields are empty.

-	When you click the ["Add"] button, the information from the input fields must be added to the div with the class "all-hits-container" and then clear input fields.  
-	The HTML structure looks like this:

-	When the ["Like song"] button is clicked:
    -	You need to take a value of the current number of likes inside the paragraph in the section with the id "total-likes" and increase the value by one.

    -	The button ["Like song"] for the current song must then be disabled, as the user has the right to like the song only once (Once the button is disabled, its color will turn gray).

-	When you click the ["Delete"] button, the song should be removed from the current section.</br>
Note: When deleting a song, you should not reduce the value of the current number of likes.
