# 1.	Reverse Strings
You will be given a series of strings until you receive an "end" command. Write a program that reverses strings and prints each pair on a separate line in the format: 
"{word} = {reversed word}".

**Examples:**

Input|	Output|Input|	Output
---|---|---|---
helLo| helLo = oLleh|Dog|Dog = goD
Softuni| Softuni = inutfoS|caT|caT = Tac
bottle|  bottle = elttob|chAir|chAir = riAhc
end	||end	

# 2.	Repeat Strings
Create a Program That Reads an Array of Strings. Each String is Repeated N Times, Where N is the length of the String. Print the Concatenated String.

**Examples:**

Input|	Output
---|---
hi abc add|	hihiabcabcabcaddaddadd
work	|workworkworkwork
ball	|ballballballball

# 3.	Substring
On the first line, you will receive a string. On the second line, you will receive a second string. 
Create a program that removes all of the occurrences of the first string in the second until there is no match. At the end print the remaining string.

**Examples:**

Input|	Output|Input|	Output
---|---|---|---
ice|kgb|hep|SoftuniIsGreat
kicegiciceeb||ShepoftunihepIsGrhepeat	

# 4.	Text Filter
Create a program that takes a text and a string of banned words. All words included in the ban list should be replaced with asterisks "\*", 
equal to the word's length. The entries in the ban list will be separated by a comma and space ", ". 
The ban list should be entered on the first input line and the text on the second input line. 

**Examples:**

Input|	Output
---|---
Linux, Windows|It is not *****, it is GNU/*****. ***** is merely the kernel, while GNU adds the functionality. Therefore we owe it to them by calling the OS GNU/*****! Sincerely, a ******* client
It is not Linux, it is GNU/Linux. Linux is merely the kernel, while GNU adds the functionality. Therefore we owe it to them by calling the OS GNU/Linux! Sincerely, a Windows client

# 5.	Digits, Letters, and Other
Create a program that receives a single string and on the first line prints all the digits, on the second – all the letters, 
and on the third – all the other characters. There will always be at least one digit, one letter, and one other character.

**Examples:**

Input|	Output|Input|	Output
---|---|---|---
Agd#53Dfg^&4F53|53453|So%f94t34U*n&i></37|943437
